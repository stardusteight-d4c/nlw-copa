# NLW Copa | Fastify with TypeScript

![banner](banner.png)

> Project made at the event `Next Level Week | Copa` held by `Rocketseat`, the purpose of this event was to build an end-to-end application
> in which people can create pools, receive a code, and so she can send her pool for friends to participate and their friends can
> send your predictions for different matches of the World Cup games. The backend of the application relies on `Fastify` to develop servers for
> web API services, `TypeScript` and `Zod` to validate, process and type data coming from requests and so that we have a more robust backend.
